# XenonReborn

The main goal of this project is to offer a basic framework to implement an old school shoot-them-up game. 
Rookies can practice algorithm and basic Java programming to acquire developement skills.

This framework is based on LibGDX and runs only on a desktop computer (Java SE 8) until now.

"XenonReborn" is a classic gradle generated by the LibGdx config tool.

Here is how the v0.1.8 looks like (Youtube) (just click on the image to launch the video)

## What's technicaly inside ?

- MVC paradigm
- Screen management and fade-in / fade-out transition (coded from scratch)
- Central assets management and loading, through enum
- Smooth random background scrolling on the menu screen
- Object states and polymorphism on every stage of the software design
- Sprite collision oded from scracth based on bounding circles
- Music playing an old format (Amiga and Atari-ST Mod format) which is very tiny compared to MP3
- Parallalax scrolling on the game screen
- Java 8 lambdas and method references.
- etc.
